# Find the Largest Element in a List

This Python program defines a function `find_maximum` that finds and returns the largest element in a list of integers. It also includes a function `find_maximum_from_user_input` that allows the user to input a list of integers and then finds and displays the largest element from that list.

## Function for Finding the Maximum Element

The `find_maximum` function is designed to find the largest element in a list of integers. It follows these steps:

```python
def find_maximum(numbers):
    """
    Find the largest element in a list of integers.
    :param numbers: A list of integers.
    :type numbers: list
    :return: The largest element in the list.
    :rtype: int or None if the list is empty.
    """
    if len(numbers) == 0:
        return None

    max_number = numbers[0]
    for number in numbers:
        if number > max_number:
            max_number = number

    return max_number
```

- It checks if the input list `numbers` is empty, and if so, it returns `None` to indicate that there is no largest element.
- It initializes `max_number` with the first element of the list.
- It then iterates through the list, comparing each element to the current maximum value (`max_number`).
- If a number in the list is greater than the current `max_number`, it updates `max_number` to that value.
- Once all elements have been checked, the function returns the largest element found.

## Function for User Input and Output

The `find_maximum_from_user_input` function allows the user to input a list of integers separated by spaces and then finds and displays the largest element from that list. It follows these steps:

```python
def find_maximum_from_user_input():
    user_input = input("Enter a list of integers separated by spaces: ")
    input_numbers = user_input.split()
    numbers = []

    for num in input_numbers:
        try:
            numbers.append(int(num))
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input! Please enter only integers separated by spaces.")
            return None

    maximum = find_maximum(numbers)

    if maximum is not None:
        print("The maximum number is:", maximum)
```

- It prompts the user to enter a list of integers separated by spaces using `input()`.
- It splits the user input into individual numbers and stores them in the `input_numbers` list.
- It then attempts to convert each item in `input_numbers` into an integer and adds it to the `numbers` list. If the conversion fails (e.g., if the user enters non-integer values), it prints an error message and returns `None`.
- After collecting valid integers in the `numbers` list, it calls the `find_maximum` function to find the largest element.
- Finally, it prints the largest element if it exists.

## Program Execution

The program concludes by calling `find_maximum_from_user_input()` to allow the user to input a list of integers and find the largest element from that list.

You can run the program, enter a list of integers as prompted, and it will display the largest element from your input.
